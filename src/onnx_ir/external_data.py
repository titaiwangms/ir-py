    It should only replace the initializers in the model with external tensors
    and not make any other modifications to the model.

    If any existing external tensor
    references the provided ``external_data`` path, it will be invalidated
    after the external data is overwritten. To obtain a valid model, use :func:`load`
    to load the newly saved model, or provide a different external data path that
    is not currently referenced by any tensors in the model.

    All initializers in the main graph and subgraphs are handled.

    When ``max_shard_size_bytes`` is set, tensors are distributed across multiple
    shard files named like ``model-00001-of-00003.data``. Because each ONNX tensor
    already carries its own ``location``, ``offset``, and ``length`` fields, no
    separate index file is required — the ONNX proto itself encodes the routing.

    Args:
        model: Model to process.
        base_dir: Path the directory where the ONNX model file is.
        relative_path: Path to which external data is to be stored, relative to the ONNX file.
            E.g. "model.data". When sharding is enabled this becomes the base name used to
            generate shard filenames such as "model-00001-of-00003.data".
        size_threshold_bytes: Save to external data if the tensor size in bytes is larger than this threshold.
        max_shard_size_bytes: Maximum cumulative size in bytes for a single shard file.
            When ``None`` (the default) all tensors are written to a single file given by
            ``relative_path``.  When set, tensors are written to multiple numbered shard
            files. If a single tensor is larger than this value, that tensor is written
            in its own oversized shard.
        callback: A callback function that is called for each tensor that is saved to external data
            for debugging or logging purposes. Under sharding the callback index reflects
            each shard's size-sorted write order while remaining globally contiguous.

    Returns:
        An ir.Model with all initializer data equal or above ``size_threshold_bytes``
        converted to external tensors.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``max_shard_size_bytes`` is not greater than 0.
        FileExistsError: When ``max_shard_size_bytes`` is set and any
            destination shard file already exists on disk. The sharded write
            path never overwrites existing files (re-saving a model whose
            shards already exist therefore requires deleting them first or
            choosing a different external data path). The single-file path
            (``max_shard_size_bytes is None``) instead overwrites
            ``relative_path`` unconditionally.

    Notes:
        Stale shards from a previous save (when the new layout produces
        fewer or differently named shard files) are the caller's
        responsibility to clean up. This function will neither delete nor
        rename pre-existing files that are not in the new destination set.
